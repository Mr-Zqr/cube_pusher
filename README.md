## About

This is a tiny robot designed by me, Xingcun Lu （陆星存）, and Shiqi Zhang（张诗琪） as a project in a practical class. The robot is designed to fit into a competition and find wooden cubes and push them onto opposite colors on the ground, the robot with fewer cubes in its ground wins. As shown in these videos.

The vertical projected area at the initial state of the robot is constrained to 100cm^2, which brought a great challenge to strategy makeup and hardware design. We finally won the second prize out of eight teams.
